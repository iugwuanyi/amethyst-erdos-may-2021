made:

(a) for payments made prior to the date of this Agreement, except that
withdrawals up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $50,000,000
equivalent may be made for payments made up to twelve months prior to
such date but on or after January 1, 2012, for Eligible Expenditures under

(b) for payments made under Category (1) unless:

@) the relevant EEP Spending Report, as referred to in Section. L.
C.1. of this Schedule, shall have been submitted to, and found
satisfactory by, the Bank, in accordance with the provisions of
the Project Operational Manual and the additional instructions
referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule; and

(ii) the applicable Budget Execution Rule, and any applicable
Disbursement-Linked Indicators have been met by the Borrower
in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, all as set forth in
the Project Operational Manual and in the additional instructions
referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule.

-21-

 
If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the Budget
Execution Rule, in respect to any Loan withdrawal under Category (1), other than
for the first, second, seventh and eighth application for withdrawal (as referred to
in the Project Operational Manual and additional instructions referred to in
Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) then, the planned disbursement amount shall be
reduced applying the Execution Coefficient in the applicable value set forth in
the Project Operational Manual and additional instructions referred to in Section
IV.A.1 of this Schedule; all as set forth therein.

If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the DLIs, in
respect to any Loan withdrawal under Category (1), other than for the first
application for withdrawal then, the planned disbursement amount (after the
application of the Budget Execution Rule above) for the third, fourth, fifth and
sixth application for withdrawal (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual
and additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) shall be
disbursed in accordance with the DLI Formula, as referred to in the Project
Operational Manual and additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of
this Schedule.

Without limitation to the provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, if the Budget
Execution Rule is only partially met, and/or the Bank has received only partial
evidence of compliance under the DLIs, and/or the Borrower has not presented
enough Eligible Expenditures under the EEPs to disburse the full planned
disbursement amounts, the Bank may, at its option, authorize that the
unwithdrawn portion of the Loan resulting from this lack of evidence be carried
forward to the subsequent withdrawals, provided that, if this occurs, the amount
to be disbursed by the Bank, in the aggregate under all subsequent withdrawals,
shall not exceed 50% of the sum of the total amounts of EEPs referred in the last
four columns of the table in Schedule 4 to this Agreement for the years up to and
including the one for which the withdrawal is made.

The amounts carried forward for subsequent withdrawals shall be disbursed as
follows:

(a) the amounts carried forward due to noncompliance with the Budget
Execution Rule in one or more Project Sectors may be disbursed only if
at the time of the subsequent withdrawal:

(i) the Budget Execution Rule has been met for the applicable
Project Sector(s); and

(ii) the Borrower has submitted documentation of Eligible

Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the withdrawal
amount requested;

22

 
 

(b) the amounts carried forward due to the non-achievement of DLIs may be
disbursed, only if at the time of the subsequent withdrawal:

@) the applicable DLIs have subsequently been achieved; and

(ii) the Borrower has submitted documentation of Eligible
Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the withdrawal
amount requested; and

(©) the amounts carried forward due to lack of documentation of Eligible
Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the amount requested for
withdrawal, may be disbursed at the time of the subsequent withdrawal
only if such amount of Eligible Expenditures is then submitted;

all in accordance with the provisions set forth or referred to in the Project
Operational Manual and the additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1
of this Schedule.

If any amount remains to be withdrawn from the Loan Account after the seventh
application for withdrawal (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual and
additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) due to
partial evidence of compliance with the Budget Execution Rule and/or the DLIs
and/or lack of documentation of Eligible Expenditures, the Bank may, at its
option, authorize such remaining amount to be disbursed as an exceptional
disbursement, prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the DLI Formula (as
referred to in the Project Operational Manual and additional instructions referred
to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) and provided the Borrower has submitted
documentation of Eligible Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the
withdrawal amount requested.

The Closing Date is November 30, 2017. The Bank may grant an extension of the

Closing Date only after the Guarantor’s Ministry of Finance has informed the
Bank that it agrees with such extension.

-23.
SCHEDULE 3
Amortization Schedule

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall
repay each Disbursed Amount in semiannual installments payable on each April
15 and October 15, the first installment to be payable on the eleventh (11th)
Interest Payment Date following the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed
Amount and the last installment to be payable on the thirtieth (30th) Interest
Payment Date following the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed Amount.
Each installment except for the last one shall be equal to one-twentieth (1/20) of
the Disbursed Amount. The last installment shall be equal to the remaining
outstanding amount of the Disbursed Amount.

If any one or more installments of principal of the Disbursed Amount would,
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Schedule, be payable after
October 15, 2031, the Borrower shall also pay on such date the aggregate amount
of all such installments.

The Bank shall notify the Loan Parties of the amortization schedule for each
Disbursed Amount promptly after the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed
Amount,

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 3 of this Schedule, in the
event of a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of a Disbursed Amount to
an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that
is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency.
