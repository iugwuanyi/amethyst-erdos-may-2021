Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1
of this Schedule.

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be

amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
